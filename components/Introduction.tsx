          I&apos;m a software developer based in Florida. My background is in
          Full-Stack Typescript-React Development, though I have shifted focus
          onto backend server design and development using Node.js. I enjoy
          snowboarding, brewing, logistics video games, photography and playing
          musical instruments.
